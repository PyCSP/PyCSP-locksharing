This implementation of PyCSP uses the lock sharing technique from the [CPA 2018 paper](http://wotug.cs.unlv.edu/cpa2018/preprints/02-preprint.pdf). The implementation relies on the CFuture described in the paper, combining the lock management of Condition variables with result passing from Futures. 

See [the PyCSP web page](https://pycsp.github.io/) or the [PyCSP GitHub organisation](https://github.com/PyCSP) for more links and references to the different PyCSP implementations.
