# ParDelta2 issues.
#
# JCSP reuses threads for which, which may reduce some of the overhead.
# Python threads are not as easy to restart.
#
# One option is to set up a reader process that passes the message to two
# writer processes. Essentially composing a Par(reader, Par(writer, writer)).
#
# The question is how to send data from the reader to the writers:
# - Using a channel would essentially just create SeqDelta2 with more overhead, apart from one thing:
#   The writer processes effectively become length 1 buffers, so the reader is able to start getting
#   the new message before both writers complete. This would change the semantics.
#   To remedy this, the writers would have to send a message back to reader (using an additional channel)
#   after then have passed on the message on the output channel.
# - using barriers:
#   - writers join barrier (a)
#   - read from cin, set value on shared state (single writer, multiple readers)
#   - join barrier (a) with the writers
#   - everyone released:
#     - read end joins the (b) barrier
#     - writers copy the value and write it to their output channels, then join the (b) barrier.
#   This complicates termination and poison handling.
# The better solution is probably to use AltDelta2. It is simpler to reason about and has
# less overhead.
